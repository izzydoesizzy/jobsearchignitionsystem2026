      <p class="section-label">The Problem</p>
      <h2 class="section-heading">You've tried grinding alone. Let's try building together.</h2>

      <p>You want accountability — not just advice you'll "get to later."</p>
      <p>You want to see your achievements written out and think: wait, I'm actually kind of incredible. You want a done-for-you resume and LinkedIn that finally reflects the professional you actually are. You want a strategy overhauled from the ground up. You want to feel recharged, not depleted, by your job search.</p>
      <p>You've run the math:</p>
      <ul class="math-list">
        <li>👉 At $100K+, every month without a job costs you ~$8,000+ in lost income</li>
        <li>👉 The average senior professional in this market is unemployed for 6–12+ months — that's up to $120K in foregone salary</li>
        <li>👉 You've applied. You've tailored. You've followed up. You've gotten silence.</li>
        <li>👉 You don't need more effort — you need a completely different system, built with you</li>
        <li>👉 And you need people in your corner — peers who get it, celebrating your wins and keeping you moving</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Welcome to the Job Search Ignition System.</p>

        <div class="pillar-chip">📅 8 weeks of building</div>
      </div>

      <p>A tight cohort of up to 10. 8 weeks of building, not just talking. Done-for-you resume, LinkedIn, and outreach assets. Three private 1:1 sessions with Izzy. Group accountability that makes this feel less like a grind and more like a team sport.</p>
      <p>This isn't a course you'll watch at 11pm and never finish. It's a hands-on program where we rebuild your job search infrastructure from the foundation up — with peers who are in it with you and 1:1 time with Izzy to make sure everything reflects you.</p>
      <p>By Week 8, you'll have 20+ assets you can use forever. You'll walk out with a strategy you actually believe in — and a belief in yourself you'd almost forgotten.</p>
      <p><strong>Sign up early and you'll get priority access to your first 1:1 session with Izzy</strong> — so your assets are in order and you're applying before the cohort even officially kicks off.</p>

          <h3 class="about-name">👋 Hi there, I'm Izzy</h3>
          <p>As a career zig-zagger and jack-of-all-trades, I've always struggled to create a coherent career story and showcase my value.</p>
          <p>I've been tormented by long periods of unemployment — feeling unclear, confused, and unmotivated — and been stuck in negative cycles that were hard to break.</p>
          <p>When I transitioned into tech, I devoured every resource about the industry. It was then I found out that anytime I attended events, people were mesmerized by my <strong>energy, resourcefulness, and genuine desire to connect and add value.</strong></p>
          <p>Then it clicked: my unique intersection of skills <em>was</em> my value — partnerships, community, events, mentorship, rapid execution, and problem-solving.</p>
          <p><strong>That's when job opportunities started to bubble up.</strong></p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="about-block about-block-flip">
        <div class="about-block-text">
          <p>Since 2016, I've been on a mission to create the support network and community I wished I had when I was struggling in silence.</p>
          <p><strong>Here's a snapshot:</strong></p>
          <ul class="about-list">
            <li><strong>Empowering Job Seekers:</strong> I've taken clients from over a year of unemployment to job offers within weeks, helped them increase their salaries by $30K, and given them confidence in their negotiation skills — guiding hundreds to feel valued and worthy again.</li>
            <li><strong>Building Community:</strong> I founded a 900+ member peer-mentorship community for job-seekers.</li>
            <li><strong>Media Features:</strong> I've been featured on podcasts and radio shows including CBC's For What It's Worth, Notable Life, CreateCommunity, and more.</li>
            <li><strong>Workshops:</strong> I've been asked to deliver workshops for UofT, TMU, Humber College, CivicAction YouthConnect, Lighthouse Labs, and the United Nations Association in Canada.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>With that said, welcome to the ClearCareer Community! I'm excited to see you inside!</p>

          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer" hidden>
            <p>Both - that's what makes it different. You get three private sessions with Izzy plus 8 weeks inside a cohort of 10 senior professionals navigating the same search. The group accountability is where most of the magic happens.</p>

          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer" hidden>
            <p>Most coaches give you advice and send you home to implement it alone. Here, everything gets built with you: resume written, LinkedIn sections drafted, outreach templates ready. You leave with 20+ real deliverables - not a to-do list.</p>

          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer" hidden>
            <p>Yes. The program is fully remote and open to professionals in Canada, the US, and internationally. All sessions are virtual.</p>

          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer" hidden>
            <p>Not necessarily. Many clients are employed but quietly exploring their options. If you're at least preparing to search within the next 3 months, you're ready.</p>

          <div class="faq-answer" hidden>
            <p>Week 1 starts with your AI Intake Interview and Kickoff session with Izzy. Weeks 2-7 are weekly group calls plus ongoing WhatsApp support as you apply your new system. Week 4 is your Mid-Review and Week 8 is your Closing Call.</p>

          <div class="faq-answer" hidden>
            <p>No one can promise you a job - I won't pretend otherwise. I do guarantee you'll leave with a complete, professional-grade system built for your specific search. Clients using this system have landed roles within 3-8 weeks after spending 6-12 months stuck.</p>
