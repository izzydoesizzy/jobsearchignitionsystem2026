# Job Search Ignition System

### by ClearCareer

**An 8-week, done-with-you program for senior professionals who are tired of sending applications into the void.**

🔥 **6 Founding Spots Available**
**BEGINS [YOUR COHORT START DATE]**

***

**You've been doing everything right. Let's figure out why it's not working.**

You have the experience. You have the skills. You've updated your resume three times. You've applied to 50, 100, maybe 200+ jobs.

And still — nothing. Or worse, you're getting a few interviews but not converting. Or you're employed right now, quietly looking, and you don't have the time or energy to figure this out while also performing at full capacity in your current role.

Maybe you've looked at expensive coaching programs. Maybe you hired a resume writer and got a generic template back that didn't sound like you. Maybe you've tried the LinkedIn tips, the ChatGPT hacks, the webinars — and none of it has moved the needle.

You know this much:

👉 You want a complete system — not a pile of tips to "go implement yourself"\
👉 You want someone to actually build this *with* you, not just tell you what to do\
👉 You want your resume, LinkedIn, outreach, and interviews working together as one machine\
👉 You want to use AI to your advantage — not feel left behind by it\
👉 You want to feel like a professional again, not a desperate applicant

Welcome to the **Job Search Ignition System**.

An 8-week, done-with-you program where I build your complete job search toolkit from scratch — using AI, custom to your experience, your target roles, and your market. You leave with 20+ professional assets, a strategic targeting plan, an automated outreach system, and interview readiness that actually converts.

## 🧑🏼‍🤝‍🧑🏽 Who It's For

- You have 7–15 years of experience in tech, product, data, engineering, finance, or marketing
- You're earning (or targeting) \$90K–\$160K and you know your worth — you just can't seem to get it across on paper
- You've been applying for months with little to no response, and you're starting to wonder if something is broken
- OR you were just laid off with severance and you need to move fast, with a real system behind you
- OR you're employed and quietly searching — and you need something that works around your schedule without blowing your cover
- You're motivated, coachable, and ready to do the work — you just need the right toolkit

**If you're already applying a lot but not converting — you are exactly who this was built for. The motivation is already there. We just need to fix the system.**

## 📝 Frequently Asked Questions

**"I'm currently employed. Can I still do this without my boss finding out?"**\
Yes — and this program was designed with exactly that in mind. The AI Intake is completed on your own time. Your three 1:1 sessions can be booked during a lunch break or on a WFH morning. WhatsApp support is fully async. There are no mandatory group video calls. 90% of the work gets done *for* you — you review, refine, and apply. Nobody at your current company needs to know a thing.

**"What are the call times?"**\
All 1:1 sessions are scheduled during weekday business hours (9am–5pm ET). If you're on Pacific time, UK, or Australian time, we'll find windows that work within reasonable overlap.

**"Is this a group program or 1:1?"**\
Both. You get 3 private 1:1 sessions with Izzy, plus unlimited async support during office hours. The "group" component is a cohort WhatsApp community — your peers going through the same program at the same time. There are no mandatory group video calls. This is intentional: it keeps things flexible whether you're employed or not, and it means the community support is there when you want it, not scheduled into your calendar.

**"What if I land a job mid-program?"**\
That's the goal. If you land during the 8 weeks, we pivot your remaining sessions to salary negotiation and onboarding strategy. You keep every asset we've built together.

**"Will you guarantee I get a job?"**\
I won't promise a job — and any coach who does is either being misleading or has 14 footnotes in their guarantee. What I *do* guarantee: the deliverables. A specific list of 20+ professional assets, built to your exact situation and market. Past clients have landed in as little as 3 weeks after implementing the system. Others have taken 3 months. The system works — but the market and your execution are variables I can't control.

**"I can just do this myself with ChatGPT."**\
You could. If you have 40+ hours, know exactly which prompts to use, can objectively evaluate your own positioning, and have the energy to execute all of this while also job searching full-time. Most people who try it alone spend 4–6 months going in circles. At \$120K/year, that's \$40,000–\$60,000 in lost income. This program costs less than three weeks of your current salary.

**"What industries do you work with?"**\
Tech, product, data, engineering, finance, and marketing. Clients across North America, the UK, and Australia. This program is built for professionals who are staying in their lane and going deeper — not for career pivoters making a full switch.

**"Can I get a refund?"**\
Because cohort spots are limited and your assets start being built in Week 1, refunds aren't available once the program begins. If something comes up before your start date, reach out and we'll work something out.

**"Who is Izzy, and why should I trust him?"**\
Fair question. I've helped hundreds of professionals navigate job searches since 2016. My clients have landed at Google, Amazon, RBC, Shopify, the World Bank, and dozens of growing companies. The average salary increase among clients who negotiated using my framework: **\$20K+.** I've been featured on CBC Radio, Global News, Newsweek, and Inc. Magazine, and I've run programs with Lighthouse Labs, the University of Toronto, and the United Nations Association in Canada.

But the thing I'm most proud of? I'm someone who actually picks up the WhatsApp message when you're panicking before your final interview.

> *"I texted Izzy right before the most important interview of my search. He sent me a 5-slide framework in minutes. I walked in like a consultant, listened to their challenges, and wrote my own job description. I got the job — after being unemployed for a full year."*\
> **— Kristin D., Account Manager**

> *"I was unemployed for a year. After working with Izzy, I was employed in three weeks."*\
> **— Kristin D.**

> *"I landed multiple interviews and negotiated a \$20K salary increase — plus a \$5–10K bonus I didn't have before."*\
> **— Tamara G., Customer Success Manager**

> *"After 12 months and 500+ applications, I revamped my resume with Izzy. Within 2 weeks, I had 3 new interviews."*\
> **— Victor P., Senior Project Manager**
