## The Problem

You're a senior professional earning or targeting $100K+. You're smart, experienced, and motivated. And yet:

- You've sent 50–200+ applications and gotten silence back
- Every month without a job costs you $8,000+ in lost income
- You've tried other coaches who gave you advice and left you to implement it alone
- You're exhausted, second-guessing yourself, and running out of runway

**You don't need more effort. You need a completely different system.**

## The Secret Weapon: SuperNova™

**SuperNova™** is a proprietary AI career intelligence system built by Izzy. It's the thing no other career coach on the planet has.

**How it works:**
1. You complete a dynamic 30-minute AI interview — adaptively changing questions extract maximum detail about your experience
2. SuperNova™ combines your interview with your existing resume
3. It generates a comprehensive **20-page personalized career toolkit**
4. Izzy personally reviews and polishes every page before you see it

**What would take a traditional career coach 20–40 hours to produce, SuperNova™ delivers in under 2 hours.**
